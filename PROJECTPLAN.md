# Project Plan


### 1. User Account Login 
Visitors will be able to sign up for a new account with their UWO username that we will append with @uwo.ca.  The users will be sent an email in which they will authenticate their email address by following the given and will be redirected to the login page.  From there, and later instances, they will be able to sign in with their usernames and passwords they signed up with.


### 2. Schedule
Users will be able to add courses by course code and section to their schedule shown on the home page.  The data is complete with web scraping done from the Western Student Services Timetable.  Using fullcalendar.io, the user can see their added courses on weekly calendar in an aesthetic way.


### 3. Friends Feature
Through the friends page, users can make a refined search of people by their username and add request to add them as a friend.  The requests will show on the friends page as well and in order for friends to be added, users must accept the friend request.  Then, the friends are added to the list of friends side of the friends page.  When a friend's name is selected, a user is taken to their friend's schedule.
