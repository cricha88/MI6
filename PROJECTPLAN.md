# Project Plan


### 1. User Account 
Visitors will be able to sign up with for an account with their UWO username that we append with @uwo.ca.  They will be able to modify information on their account.


### 2. Search for friends
For each class that the user in enrolled in, a list of other students in that class using the application will show up.  Users will also be able to search for people they know by name using the application, independent of whether they share classes.


### 3. Add and delete friends
After finding a friend, one sees a button request to add them.  If the other party accepts the request.  If a user want to delete a friend, the connection is interrupted without the other party needing to accept.


### 4. View friends
Friends can be seen on the study buddy panel.  They will be grouped into the respective classes or study groups shared between both users if applicable.  


### 5. Chat
By clicking on a friend's name in the study buddy panel, a direct chat between the two people will commence.  Previous messages will show up prior to most recent messages.  There will also be group chats, and class chats.


### 6. Select classes
Users will select the subject, course code, and section to add a class to their schedule shown on the home page.  We will need to perform web scraping on the timetable website: http://studentservices.uwo.ca/secure/timetables/mastertt/ttindex.cfm to collect data on class schedules.


### 7. Obtain Badges
Users obtain badges for class attendance streaks, logging study time, and other progressions through using the application.
 

### 8. Self-accountability
Users will be able to check in to class once the class is in session.  A history of classes attended or unattended will result in badges for class attendance streaks, and allows users to be accountable for missing class because it is in their history.  Looking back, a user could see which class they missed to get the notes they need.  Also, users can log study time which will result in badges and holds users responsible for their studying.
