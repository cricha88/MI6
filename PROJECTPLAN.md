# Project Plan


### 1. User Account Login 
Visitors will be able to sign up for a new account with their UWO username that we will append with @uwo.ca.  The users will be sent an email in which they will authenticate their email address by following the given and will be redirected to the login page.  From there, and later instances, they will be able to sign in with their usernames and passwords they signed up with.


### 2. Schedule
Users will be able to add courses by course code and section to their schedule shown on the home page.  The data is complete with web scraping done from the Western Student Services Timetable.  Using fullcalendar.io, the user can see their added courses on weekly calendar in an aesthetic way.


### 3. Attendance
Users will be able to click on an instance of a course on the weekly schedule and mark it as attended or unattended. They can only click to mark as attended if the class has happened. A history of classes attended or unattended will allows user to be accountable for missing class because it is in their history page.  Looking back, a user could see which class they missed to get the notes they need.


### 4. Weekly Statistics
A pie chart of the current week's statistics will be displayed on the side of the home page with the calendar.  By logging attendance, users will see the percentage of classes attended or unattended for that week.


### 5. Friends Feature
Through the friends page, users can make a refined search of people by their username and add request to add them as a friend.  The requests will show on the friends page as well and in order for friends to be added, users must accept the friend request.  Then, the friends are added to the list of friends side of the friends page.  When a friend's name is selected, a user is taken to their friend's schedule.
