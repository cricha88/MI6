For our UI design, we've chosen to use a primarily monochromatic colour scheme, with one lighter and one darker shade of blue. Most elements are of this colour, but there are a few exceptions (badges, attendance history, availability in the group chat, and message popups). These elements have different colours because they are important and should be noticed by the user first.

Although the overall design wasn't inspired by any one app or another, we did draw insipiration from facebook's chat interface, and Khan Academy's badge display. Facebook's chat interface is always pinned to the right side, which allows the user to open up a conversation no matter which page they are on, and also see when they've been messaged at any moment. We liked this because it made chatting convenient. We also liked Khan Academy's style of displaying their badges in a grid, with similar badges having identical designs. We found that this made a lot of sense for us, and would make the badge system understandable for the user.

When users naviagte our front end, they always have the left and right sidebars pinned, while the central page can be scrolled. This allows the user to be able to easily switch pages or sign into class without leaving their page, and as mentioned before, to start a chat at any point.
