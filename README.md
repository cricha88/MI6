## Project

(excerpt taken from proposal and will be updated.)
We are proposing a study assistant application. Itâ€™s main purpose would be to assist Western students in accomplishing their academic goals. The application will track some actions and allow users to self-report others, all while providing tools for success. It will be designed exclusively for Western students, requiring users to authenticate with a valid email address. However, in the future we may wish to expand this to include other schools. Users will interact with the application via a web based front end.
