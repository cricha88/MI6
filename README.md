## Introduction
Welcome to team 6's website for CS2212. CS2212 is an introduction to software engineering, outlining the stages of the software engineering process such as requirements gathering, specification, design, implementation, and testing of a group software term project.  

## Project
MI6 is proposing a study assistant web based application, allowing Western students to track their study habits and class attentance, connect with their classmates, and earn badges for their success.

The application, named "Study Buddy" will feature users inputting their classes from Western's timetable data, adding people in classes to friends lists, chatting with friends, checking in to a class to confirm attendance, logging a study session, rewarding users for class attendance streaks and application performance, competing with friends for badges, and more.  

Study Buddy is the streamlined social and productivity application helping Western students succeed.
