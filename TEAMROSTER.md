## Profiles

### Austin, aka the "Background Challenger" 
I’m Austin and I’m currently in second year computer science. I’ve been coding for about 4 years now and have experience with Java, C#, C, Python, Javascript, and HTML. I love logic and problem solving and will be focused on developing the back end of this project. Whenever coding any type of program I always strive to complete it in the least amount of time and be very efficient with resources. I love to challenge myself with anything I do, and take pride in solving difficult problems. When I’m not programming I enjoy playing sports and being active. Specifically, I spend a lot of time skiing, wakeboarding, and wakesurfing whenever I get the chance!


### Maya, aka the "Foreground Architect"
My name is Maya Bielecki, I’m in second year and I’ve been coding for about 16 months. I had no previous experience before starting my undergraduate computer science degree at Western. However, I feel like my skills are now at a level where I can build some really useful projects which is very exciting! Although I’m most comfortable in Java, I also have a good understanding of Python and C, and I’ve learned a bit of Javascript and HTML. Within this project, I’m most looking forward to developing the front end.  In my spare time, I like to paint and volunteer. I’m currently an upper year mentor (Soph) in the Delaware Hall residence, and I’m also a member of Western’s Student Emergency Response Team. My philosophy towards this type of work is that we must be responsible in the kinds of technology we create, and always ask ourselves – are we making this for money, or are we making this to help people?


### Casey, aka the "Database Officer"
Hi I’m Casey Graham. I’m a third-year student studying math and computer science. I started university at Brock University where I took a computer science class for fun which ended up being my favourite class.  I decided to give computer science a shot and I transferred to Western.  I have experience programming in various languages including C, Java, Python, Visual Basic, HTML, Matlab, Maple, and others.  I’m also familiar with databases and networking and I’m hoping my knowledge in these areas will be helpful to this team. I plan on overseeing the database primarily, looking after things such as optimization, eliminating redundancy, encryption and making it easy for others to work with. I’m also a partial secretary, looking after the minutes for the team meetings.  What I do with my spare time varies greatly. I like tinkering with a home server from time to time. Other than that, I mostly hang out with friends and listen to music. In the summer, I work at a telecommunications company doing primarily internet technical support.  My philosophy; logic is a valuable skill, illogic is priceless.


### Will, aka the "Background Strategist"
My name is Will Jackson, I’m a second year Computer Science major, and I have been programming since early in high school, about 6 years ago. Most of my coding experience has been in Java and Python but I have had an opportunity to work with many tools and am confident that I can learn new tools as needed.  When I’m not studying for exams or working on CS assignment, I play video-games. Specifically, I compete at local Super Smash Brother tournaments every week and am currently trying to become the best player in London. My philosophy towards programming is based on progress. It’s easy to develop software - its difficult to develop useful software.


### Caocao, aka the "Foreground Comrade"
Hi my name is Caocao Liu!  I am originally from China where I did my engineering degree in Huazhong University of Science and Technology.  That degree was more about hardware, but I'm more interested in software, because it's more flexible.  That’s why I recently started a degree in computer science at Western University.  I have many skills such as Java and C++.  Additionally, I enjoy travelling, reading, and swimming.  My general philosophy is that I don’t know why we are here, but I’m pretty sure it is in order to enjoy ourselves.


### Christine, aka the "Team General"
Hi, my name is Christine Richards and I'm currently in second year computer science pursuing and dual-degree in computer science and business administration.  A year ago, I switched into computer science from medical science after realizing I wasn't excited or curious about what I was learning.  Ever since, what I learn in computer science continues to amaze me and I am always curious to learn more; extending my skills to Java, C, Javascript, HTML, and Ruby.  I am excited to work on a project that is applicable and useful; specifically working on front end, understanding how it interacts with the back end, and using my project management skills to lead the group.  I have lots of leadership experience including being a canoe trip leader, ski instructor, campus tour guide, student leader (Soph) at Elgin Hall Residence, and project control officer at an IT consulting company this upcoming summer.  My positivity and determination are key factors to my success and have helped me achieve my motto: something that doesn't challenge you is not worth achieving.  


### Vivian, aka the "Code Messenger"
My name is Vivian Yu Wu and I’m in second year computer science. I am most comfortable with my skills in Java but also have experience with Python, C, HTML and Javascript. Additionally, I have graphic design experience.  I am currently in a stage where I have some skills but don’t really know how to apply them.  Within this project, I hope I can gain a general idea of how to communicate the front end and the back end.  I’m looking forward to contributing to both front and back end and their integration but I'm also very flexible. In my spare time I enjoy various types of music and comedy.  Currently, I am an upper year mentor (Soph) in the Essex Hall residence.


### Michael, aka the "Background Comrade"
My name is Yixin Zhang, or you can call me Michael. I’m a third-year international student from China. Currently, I’m taking computer science degree at Western. During these years of study, I have become sufficient in Java and C.  Also, I have a good understanding of HTML and some useful database knowledge.  I have the confidence to develop our project with my group.  In my spare time, I like to play sports and PC videogames. I have been working out with weights for months and I play basketball when I can.  PC games can motivate me to approach the latest PC technologies which has enabled me to clarify the direction of computer science degree.
